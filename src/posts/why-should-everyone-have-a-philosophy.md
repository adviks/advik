What do you think is easier to do? To study or to scroll through Reels? To be loyal and honest or to be disloyal and dishonest? To work out or to sit around? To overeat or to eat less?

Now change the question and ask yourself, what is the right thing to do? In most cases, you'll find that the right things are not easier to do. That's how it is. It takes a man or a woman of character and virtue to suppress their temptations and act in the right way.

In your capacity as a civil servant, as well as a human being, it's important to act and behave in an upright manner. That's why I think everyone should read philosophy and create their own philosophy.

It's very important to have standards in terms of what you do and why you do it. Ask yourself this question constantly when you're about to do something that matters, "Will my ideal self act in the same way as I'm about to act?" Philosophy helps you to realize and create an ideal self.

One particular philosophy that has shaped me in my life is the philosophy of Stoicism. I discovered it at a very young age and I'm grateful for that. The basic idea of stoicism is to be indifferent to external circumstances. Read about it.

Stoicism isn't the only philosophyâ€” most religions have their own philosophies. These philosophies are also good. So read through various philosophies that interest you and create your own.
